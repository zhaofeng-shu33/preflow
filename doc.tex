In the implementation of Preflow algrithms, we differentiate
two types of \textbf{push}. One is normal push, that is,
$f_{uv} < c_{uv}$ and $x_u >0$, $u$ can push some stored flow
to $v$. The other is \textbf{push back}, that is,
$f_{vu} >0$ and $x_u >0$ and $u$ can push some stored flow back to $v$.

In figure \ref{fig:mc}, our algrithm will produce the minimum cut whose source side is of maximal size.
